

Function level operators --> One input, One output
(1) UnaryOperator<T>
If input and output are same type,then we should go for unary operator

It is child of Function<T,R>

(2) IntUnaryOperator
If input and output are same type and don't want to mention Integer data type as generic, then we should go for
IntUnaryOperator

-------------------
BiFunction level operators --> 2 input and one output

(3)BinaryOperator<T>  --> public T apply(T,T);
If 2 inputs and  1 output are same type,then we should go for BinaryOperator. It restricts Generic type
to only one(Since all inputs and output are of same type)

It is child of BiFunction<T,T,R>

Primitive types of binary operator
(4)IntBinaryOperator
(5)LongBinaryOperator
(6)DoubleBinaryOperator
